# inconsistent with internal/version/VERSION. Two layered assertions:
#
#   1. Tag follows the canonical MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH shape (a leading
#      "v" is accepted but not required).
#   2. Tag matches `cat internal/version/VERSION` exactly after
#      stripping a leading "v" from each side. The VERSION file is
#      the source of truth for the binary's version (embedded via
#      //go:embed); a release whose tag drifts from VERSION ships
#      a binary that misreports its own version.
#
# Usage: scripts/check-version.sh v0.4.1   # or 0.4.1
